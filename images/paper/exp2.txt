\subsubsection{Experiment2}
The purpose of this experiments is to examine performance of our self defined kernels to the different dimension of the color layers in images. As stated above, we will apply our filter to Red-Green layer, Yellow-Blue layer and Grey layer instead of Red, Green, Blue  layers of the images. We first prepare the \textbf{SuperAlexnet} and initializing the first layer with our self defined kernels. Then, we will train the model with training set and evaluate the model with validation set. The training loss, training accuracy, validation loss, and validation accuracy are recorded for each epoch of the training process, therefore the detection of convergence and overfitting during the training process can be done. Once the training is done, the performance of the model will be evaluated on the test set by calculating the accuracy of the classification. The process of training (number of epoch for the convergence, etc.) and accuracy of the model classification will be examined and compared with the baseline model \textbf{OriginalAlexnet}.
